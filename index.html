    <h2>About My Trip</h2>
    <p>In October 2023, I visited Rome just before embarking on a cruise. We spent four unforgettable days exploring the city's breathtaking history, architecture, and culture. Staying in a beautiful hotel and walking the timeless streets was a dream come true. I had longed to visit since elementary school, and I finally made it just months after graduating high school.</p>
